,Zarlino's scale is built using the ratios 4:5:6,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,Steps to derive intervals:
,Frequencies,528,,,,,,,,,,Starting frequency
,,,,660,,792,,,,,,1) derive 3 and 5 from left to right
,,,,,,,,,1056,,,2) derive 8  ( = 2x interval 1 )
,,,,,704,,880,,,,,3) derive 4 and 6 from right to left from interval 8 (octave)
,,,,,,,,990,,1188,,4) derive 7 from left to right from interval 5
,,,594,,,,,,,,,5) derive 2 by adjusting interval 9 down an octave
,Names,1,M2,M3,4,5,M6,M7,,,,6) Assign Interval names
,,C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C,D,,7) Assign letter names (C if starting freq is 528hz)
,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,m3,,,,m3,,,,"Ratios 4:5:6 produce the intervals "" 1, 4, 5"""
,,,,,,,,,,,,This scale has  a major third that exists in the harmonic series
,,,,,m3,,,,m3,,,The minor third is is derived from the M3 and the 5
,Triads,C,D,E,F,G,A,B,,,,2:1    octave
,,E,F,G,A,B,C,D,,,,3:2    fifth
,,G,A,B,C,D,E,F,,,,4:3    fourth
